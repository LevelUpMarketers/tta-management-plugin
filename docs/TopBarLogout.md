# Top Bar Logout Link

The theme's top bar markup may include an empty logout container:

```html
<div class="tta-header-logout-div">
    <a href="">Hi [USER FIRST NAME] <span> - </span> Logout</a><span> - </span>
</div>
```

This plugin automatically handles that element:

- Visitors who are not logged in see a “Log In” link that points to the
  `/login-or-create-an-account/` page.
- When a member is logged in, the plugin sets the anchor's `href` to a secure
  logout URL that redirects back to the site's homepage.
- If the link contains the placeholder `[USER FIRST NAME]`, it will be replaced
  with the logged-in member's first name. Any separator spans that surround the
  placeholder are automatically hidden when the login link is shown, so the
  markup can stay exactly as in the example above.

No additional configuration is required—simply keep the markup as shown above
in the theme or Customizer and the plugin will manage visibility and logout
behavior.
