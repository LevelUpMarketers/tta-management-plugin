# Venue Administration

The plugin tracks event venues in a dedicated table. Administrators can access **TTA Venues** under the WordPress admin menu. The page mirrors the Events screen with two tabs and the Add Venue form uses the same tooltip layout as the Events editor.

- **Add Venue** – create a new venue with name, address components and up to three extra links.
- **Manage Venues** – list existing venues in a table with inline editing using the same toggle/accordion behaviour as the Events manager.

When creating or editing an event, selecting a saved venue from the autocomplete list will automatically populate all venue-related fields including address, the main venue link and the three optional extra links.
