# TTA BI Dashboard

The **TTA BI Dashboard** appears as its own menu item in the WordPress admin. The existing Events, Members, and Predictive Analytics tabs have been intentionally cleared so the dashboards can be redesigned from scratch. The tabs remain visible, but they currently display placeholder messaging only.

## Current State

- **Event Revenue Info tab**: Lists archived events with a basic search/sort header and pagination. Rows expand accordion-style, but the detail panel is intentionally blank while the revenue layout is rebuilt.
- **Members tab**: Placeholder only while new UI and data logic are rebuilt.
- **Predictive Analytics tab**: Placeholder only while new UI and data logic are rebuilt.

No charting scripts or AJAX handlers are active for the dashboard at this time. New data sources, caching, and visualizations should be documented here as soon as the rebuild work begins.
