# TTA BI Dashboard

The **TTA BI Dashboard** appears as its own menu item in the WordPress admin. The existing Events, Members, and Predictive Analytics tabs have been intentionally cleared so the dashboards can be redesigned from scratch. The tabs remain visible, but they currently display placeholder messaging only.

## Current State

- **Events tab**: Placeholder only while new UI and data logic are rebuilt.
- **Members tab**: Placeholder only while new UI and data logic are rebuilt.
- **Predictive Analytics tab**: Placeholder only while new UI and data logic are rebuilt.

No charting scripts or AJAX handlers are active for the dashboard at this time. New data sources, caching, and visualizations should be documented here as soon as the rebuild work begins.
