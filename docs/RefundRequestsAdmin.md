# TTA Refund Requests Page

The **TTA Refund Requests** admin screen lists every refund submitted from a member's dashboard. Entries appear in a table showing when the request was made, the attendee name, the event and the amount paid for that ticket. Each row also shows the details typed by the member when they requested the refund and includes a **Refund Now** button so administrators can process the refund immediately. Requests remain visible until the refund is processed automatically or the event has passed so administrators can review all outstanding items.

If a member purchased multiple tickets in the same transaction the request specifies the ticket ID so only the relevant attendee(s) appear in the table.

After a refund request the attendee is removed but the ticket is held in a refund pool rather than adding back to inventory. Tickets from this pool are only released once all regular tickets sell out the **first** time. After that initial sell out, any new refund requests are immediately available for purchase and notify members on the waitlist. The member is not refunded until one of these pooled tickets is purchased by another attendee. Requests are processed in the order they were received, so the oldest pending refund is attempted first. If a refund must wait for the original transaction to settle, all action buttons for that request stay disabled until settlement completes. Clicking **Refund Now** processes the refund immediately and returns the seat to the normal inventory.

Pending refund tickets are never offered while a last remaining seat is merely reserved in someone's cart. Inventory from the refund pool is released only after the final standard ticket has been successfully purchased with no outstanding cart reservations.
Processed requests disappear from the list once the refund is issued or the request expires. Any requests still pending within two hours of the event are removed without a refund.
