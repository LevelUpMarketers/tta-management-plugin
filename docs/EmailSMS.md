# Email and SMS Templates

The plugin sends automated notifications to members. Administrators can manage these messages from **TTA Email & SMS** in the WordPress admin. The page contains four tabs:

1. **Communication Templates** – editor for email and SMS message content described below.
2. **Mass Communications** – send a one-off email to all verified attendees of a selected event.
3. **Email Logs** – lists scheduled reminder and thank‑you emails grouped by event. Reminder jobs are automatically queued whenever an event is created or its start time changes and are scheduled using the site's timezone setting. Post-event thank‑you emails are also scheduled when the event is created and run 18 hours after the event ends for attendees who checked in. Each entry shows the send time in `MM-DD-YYYY HH:MMAM/PM` format along with a live `HH H, MM M, SS S` countdown using the site's timezone, exposes its current recipient list via AJAX, and can be deleted before it runs.
4. **Email History** – a running log of all attempted emails including recipient address and delivery result. A **Clear Log** button removes all entries.

Templates are listed in a table similar to the Manage Events page. Click a row to expand an inline form containing the fields for that communication. Each form has its own **Save Changes** button and progress spinner.

## Mass Communications Tab

Select an event from the dropdown to automatically load the email addresses of all verified attendees. The list can be edited before sending so additional recipients can be added or removed. Enter a subject and body, insert any of the standard email tokens, preview the message and press **Send Email** to notify everyone at once.

Each template stores:

- **Type** – whether the message is sent to members (External) or used internally
- **Category** – grouping such as Event Reminder or Event Confirmation
- **Email Subject** – subject line of the email
- **Email Body** – text shown above the automatically generated event details (all templates except `checkin_broadcast`)
- **Opening Greeting / Closing Statement** – only for the `checkin_broadcast` template; the message typed on the Event Check-In page is inserted between these two fields when the email is sent
- **SMS Text** – short message sent via SMS

All fields are sanitized with the helper functions from `InputSanitization.md`. This strips WordPress slashes so apostrophes display correctly in the admin preview and in the actual emails.

Default values are provided on initial install:

- **Purchase Email Subject**: "Thanks for Registering!"
- **Purchase Email Body**: "You're in! Thank for registering for our upcoming Trying To Adult event. The details of the event are below. Please keep this email, as you'll need to present this to the Event Host or Volunteer when arriving at your event."
- **Purchase SMS**: "Thanks for registering! View your upcoming events at "
- **24-Hour Reminder Email Body**: "Heads-up! Your event is just 1 day away! Below are the details."
- **2-Hour Reminder Email Body**: "Your event is only 2 hours away! Below are the details."
- **Cancellation Requested Email Body**: "We're sorry you can't make it! Your attendance has been cancelled. Be sure to check out our other upcoming events here. See you next time!"
- **Membership Purchase Email Subject**: "Welcome to your membership!"
- **Membership Purchase Email Body**: "Thanks for becoming a {membership_level} member. You now have access to member benefits. Manage your membership anytime from your dashboard."
- **Membership Cancellation Email Body**: "Your {membership_level} membership is now cancelled. We're sorry to see you go and hope to see you again soon!"
- **Membership Change Email Subject**: "Your membership has been updated"
- **Membership Change Email Body**: "Your membership is now {membership_level} at {membership_price} per month."
- **Admin Notifications**: internal alerts are sent when events sell out.
- **Host and Volunteer Reminders**: internal messages mirror attendee reminders at 24 and 2 hours before the event.

Links to the member dashboard now output the full site URL and include direct links to each dashboard tab, including the waitlist view.

## Scheduled SMS Reminders

For the **24-Hour Event Reminder**, **2-Hour Event Reminder**, and **Post-Event Thank You** templates, the cron jobs that already schedule reminder emails now also queue SMS messages. When those hooks fire, the SMS handler compiles the template text using the same token replacements as emails and sends messages through Twilio to each verified attendee who opted in to SMS updates during checkout. Attendees who unchecked the **text me updates about this event** box or do not have a phone number on file are skipped automatically, and sandbox mode continues to redirect all messages to the configured sandbox number.

## Event Check-In Broadcasts

Hosts and volunteers can send an on-the-fly update to everyone associated with an event from the **Email All Attendees** panel on the Event Check-In page. The admin template `checkin_broadcast` supplies the reusable pieces of that message: the subject line plus the opening greeting and closing statement. When a host submits the form:

- The message typed on the check-in page is sanitized to strip HTML, emoji, and control characters while preserving line breaks.
- Tokens in the subject, greeting, closing, and typed message are replaced per recipient using the same `build_tokens()` helper as other communications, so placeholders such as `{attendee_first_name}` personalize each email.
- The system emails every verified attendee regardless of check-in status as well as all hosts and volunteers tied to the event.
- The final email body inserts the typed message between the stored opening and closing text with blank lines separating each section.
- Each send is written to the **Email History** tab, and the host-facing textarea requires at least 20 substantive characters before the **Send Email** button becomes active to avoid empty blasts.

If no recipients are found or the template is missing, the interface returns an error and no mail is sent.

## Previews and Tokens

Editing a template shows live **Email Preview** and **SMS Preview** boxes. Values are updated whenever an input field loses focus. For reminder and purchase templates, the preview substitutes details from the soonest upcoming event in the database, choosing the earliest date and start time.

SMS previews show a character count. If the text exceeds 160 characters the count turns red to indicate the message may be split by carriers.

Buttons labelled with tokens (e.g. `{event_name}`) insert placeholders into the last focused field. The sending logic will replace these tokens with real data. Available tokens include:

### Event Information

```
{event_name}
{event_address}
{event_address_link}
{event_link}
{dashboard_profile_url}
{dashboard_upcoming_url}
{dashboard_waitlist_url}
{dashboard_past_url}
{dashboard_billing_url}
{event_date}
{event_time}
{event_type}
{venue_name}
{venue_url}
{base_cost}
{member_cost}
{premium_cost}
```

`{event_address_link}` outputs a Google Maps URL for the event address.

Dashboard URL tokens accept an optional `anchor` attribute. For example:

```
{dashboard_upcoming_url anchor="see your upcoming events"}
```

This outputs a clickable link using the provided anchor text. When the anchor is
empty or omitted the full URL is printed.

`{event_date}` outputs the event date formatted like "June 28th, 2025". `{event_time}` shows the start and end times in 12‑hour format with am/pm, e.g. "6:00 pm - 8:00 pm".

### Member Information

```
{first_name}
{last_name}
{email}
{phone}
{membership_level}
{membership_price}
{subscription_id}
{member_type}
```

`{membership_level}` will automatically capitalize the member's level (e.g., "Standard" or "Premium").

### Date & Time

```
{current_time}
{current_date}
{current_weekday}
{current_month}
{current_day_of_month}
```

All values reflect Eastern Time when the message is sent. `{current_time}` outputs a human-readable time like `1:32 PM` and `{current_date}` formats as `9/3/2025`.

### Ban & Re-Entry

```
{reentry_link}
```

Insert `{reentry_link}` to output `/checkout?auto=reentry`. Wrap it in Markdown—`[Re-entry Ticket]({reentry_link})`—to create a clickable link that, when the member is logged in, clears any existing items and automatically adds the Re-entry Ticket to their cart. Unauthenticated visitors simply land on the checkout page.

### Event Attendee Information

```
{attendee_first_name}
{attendee_last_name}
{attendee_email}
{attendee_phone}
{attendee2_first_name}
{attendee2_last_name}
{attendee2_email}
{attendee2_phone}
{attendee3_first_name}
{attendee3_last_name}
{attendee3_email}
{attendee3_phone}
{attendee4_first_name}
{attendee4_last_name}
{attendee4_email}
{attendee4_phone}
{assistance_message}
```

Each attendee receives a personalized email where these tokens reflect their own details. `{assistance_message}` contains any note submitted through the assistance form on the member dashboard.

### Host & Volunteer Information

```
{event_host}
{event_volunteer}
{host_notes}
```

If no hosts or volunteers are assigned to an event, `{event_host}` and
`{event_volunteer}` default to `TBD`.

### Refund Information

```
{refund_first_name}
{refund_last_name}
{refund_email}
{refund_amount}
{refund_ticket}
{refund_event_name}
{refund_event_date}
{refund_event_time}
```

### Assistance Message

These tokens insert details from a member's assistance request. Missing values default to `N/A`.

```
{assistance_message}
{assistance_first_name}
{assistance_last_name}
{assistance_email}
{assistance_phone}
```

### Formatting & Styling

The editor provides helper buttons beneath the token sections:

- **Link This Text** – prompts for a URL or token and wraps the selected text
  in `[text](url)` Markdown. Links are converted to clickable `<a>` tags when
  the email is sent.
- **Line Break** – inserts a newline. Email previews render these as HTML
  `<br>` tags so the saved text remains plain.
- **Bold** – wraps the highlighted text with `**` markers. The enclosed text
  appears in bold in the final email.
 - **Italic** – wraps the highlighted text with `*` markers. Text appears in italics in the final email.

Styling markers can be combined, so `***bold & italic***` renders as bold and italic.

Template text can include Markdown-style links directly, so
`[{event_name}]({event_link})` resolves to a link with the event name and URL.

### Formatting Helpers

The helpers `tta_format_event_date()` and `tta_format_event_time()` convert raw
database values into the human-friendly strings shown by `{event_date}` and
`{event_time}`. `tta_format_event_datetime()` is a convenience wrapper that
returns both values combined in a single string.

## Email Delivery

All plugin emails are sent from "Trying To Adult" (<noreply@tryingtoadultrva.com>) and automatically Bcc onlineservices@leveluprichmond.com for internal tracking.

All outgoing messages are dispatched by the `TTA_Email_Handler` class. The handler is loaded on plugin init and is responsible for reading the templates saved on the **Email & SMS** page. After a transaction is recorded, `send_purchase_emails()` groups the purchased items by event and emails the **Successful Event Purchase** template. The purchasing member receives one email and each attendee gets a personalized copy where tokens like `{attendee_first_name}` reflect their own information. Duplicate addresses are skipped so each email address only receives one message.

## SMS Delivery

SMS notifications are sent through Twilio. The `TTA_SMS_Handler` class mirrors
the email handler and reads the SMS text from the same template set. When the
Twilio credentials are configured, members and attendees receive text messages
for purchases, refunds and waitlist openings. If credentials are missing no SMS
is dispatched and a notice appears in the WordPress admin.

Twilio credentials can be managed directly from **TTA Settings → API Settings**.
Provide the Twilio User SID (account SID), API SID, and API Key generated for
your API credential pair. Supply either a Messaging Service SID or a Sending
Number so the plugin knows which sender identity to use when delivering SMS
messages. Select the Twilio Environment (Live or Sandbox) to control where
messages are delivered during testing. When Sandbox mode is enabled all SMS
are routed to the configured Twilio Sandbox Number, ensuring real members do
not receive test messages. When sandbox mode is active without a sandbox number
the plugin suppresses SMS delivery and displays an admin warning so test sends
cannot reach real phones by mistake. These values are stored securely in the
WordPress options table and are also consumable via environment variables for
deployment flexibility.
