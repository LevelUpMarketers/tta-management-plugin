# Event Type Options

The **Event Type** dropdown in the admin screens controls who can attend an event based on their membership level.

- **Open Event** – anyone may attend. No website account or membership is required.
- **Basic Membership Required** – attendees must log in and have at least a Basic membership. Premium members are also eligible.
- **Premium Membership Required** – only Premium members can attend. Users must be logged in.

Existing events created before this change may still use the old labels (Free, Paid, Member Only) but they map to the new meanings above.
