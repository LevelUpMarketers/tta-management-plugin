# Admin List Sorting Options

Several admin pages include dropdowns to change the order of list tables. The dropdowns now start with a disabled **Sort By…** option so it’s clear no custom order is active until one is selected. A **Clear Sorting** button beside each dropdown reloads the page without any sorting or pagination parameters.

- **Member History** and **Manage Members** can sort by membership length, total amount spent, events attended, first name, last name or join date.
- **Manage Events** can sort upcoming events first (default) or by date ascending/descending or alphabetically by name.
- **Archived Events** can sort newest or oldest first or alphabetically by name.

Use the dropdown above each table to select an order and results will refresh automatically. Clicking **Clear Sorting** returns you to the default view. When viewing the first page of results, up to the first twenty pages are now shown in the pagination links for easier navigation.
