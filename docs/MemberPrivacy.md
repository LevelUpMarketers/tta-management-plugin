# Member Privacy Options

Members can control certain privacy settings on their profile. A new checkbox **Hide Event Attendance** allows a member to hide their profile image and name from the attendee list on event pages.

Admins can set this option when creating or editing a member, and members can adjust it themselves from the dashboard profile tab. The setting defaults to unchecked.

When enabled, event pages replace the member's first name with a sequential label such as "Attendee #1" and use a placeholder image instead of their profile picture.
