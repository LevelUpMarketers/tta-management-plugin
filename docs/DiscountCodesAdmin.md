# TTA Discount Codes Page

The **TTA Discount Codes** screen lets administrators create global discount codes that apply to any cart. These one-off codes are independent of individual events and stack with event-specific discounts.

The menu entry now uses the WordPress `dashicons-tag` icon to match other dashboard items.

Each code has three fields:

- **Discount Code** – the text users enter at checkout.
- **Discount Type** – choose a percentage off or a flat dollar amount.
- **Discount Amount** – numeric value for the discount.

Use **Add Discount Code** to insert additional rows. Existing rows can be removed with the × button. Click **Save Discount Codes** when finished. Codes are stored in a dedicated table and cached for quick lookups.
